1. Review some single loop stuff we have done in the past.
1. Look at an example of a loop with conditionals so that students feel better about loops doing something more than just a single thing every time
1. Do a live code of a nested loop
1. Students work on intro activity, generally have 3 or 4 actvities like number 1 to let the students get a good deal of practive. Do this in partners or groups or informal grouping and peer support. 
1. Move on to more complex examples like #2, do 4 or 5.
1. Have students come up with something funny to do with a dual nested loop, vote as a class on which one to do, impliment it.
